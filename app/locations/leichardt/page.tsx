  <h3>Common Sliding Door Problems We Can Fix</h3>
  <p>
    Sliding doors are convenient but can develop problems over time due to wear
    and tear. Here are some of the most common issues that our technicians can
    help with:
  </p>
  <div className="inner-box sd">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Sticking or Hard-to-Open Doors</strong>: Over time, the rollers
        or tracks may become damaged, causing the door to stick or become
        difficult to slide. We can repair or replace the rollers, ensuring
        smooth operation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Broken or Misaligned Tracks</strong>: If the track becomes bent
        or damaged, the door may not slide properly. Our technicians can realign
        the track or replace it entirely.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Damaged Glass</strong>: If your sliding door glass is cracked or
        shattered, we offer fast and reliable glass replacement services to
        restore safety and functionality.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Faulty Locks</strong>: If your sliding door lock is broken or
        not functioning properly, we can repair or replace it with a
        high-quality locking mechanism to keep your home secure.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Leaking or Drafty Doors</strong>: In many cases, sliding doors
        that are improperly sealed can allow drafts, rain, or pests into your
        home. We can fix these issues and make sure your door is sealed
        correctly.
