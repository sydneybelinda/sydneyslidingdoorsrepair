  <h4>Common Sliding Door Issues We Repair</h4>
  <p>
    At <strong>Sydney Sliding Doors Repair</strong>, we handle a wide range of
    sliding door issues. Here are some of the most common problems our team
    deals with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Stuck or Jammed Doors:</strong> If your sliding door won’t move,
        it could be due to a build-up of dirt and debris in the tracks or
        damaged rollers. We will clean and realign the tracks or replace the
        faulty rollers.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Squeaky or Noisy Doors:</strong> A noisy door is often a sign
        that the rollers are worn out or the tracks need lubrication. We offer
        maintenance and repair services to reduce the noise and restore smooth
        operation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Broken Glass:</strong> Whether it’s a crack or shattered glass,
        we provide replacement and repair services to ensure your sliding door
        is secure and safe to use.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Damaged Tracks or Rollers:</strong> The tracks and rollers are
        vital to the function of your sliding door. If either is damaged or
        misaligned, your door may not slide properly. Our team will repair or
        replace these components to ensure smooth operation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Weatherproofing Issues:</strong> If your sliding door isn’t
        sealing properly, it may lead to drafts and energy inefficiency. We
        offer weatherproofing and seal replacements to keep your home
        comfortable year-round.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Alignment Problems:</strong> Over time, sliding doors can become
        misaligned, causing them to stick or not close properly. Our technicians
        can realign your door, ensuring it works like new.
