  <h4>Common Aluminum Sliding Door Issues We Repair</h4>
  <p>
    Aluminum sliding doors are a popular choice for homes and businesses due to
    their sleek design and durability. However, like any door, they can
    experience problems over time. Below are some of the most common issues we
    repair:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Sticking or Jammed Doors:</strong> Sliding doors can become
        difficult to open or close if the track is dirty, misaligned, or if the
        rollers are damaged. Our technicians can clean and realign the track or
        replace the rollers, ensuring your door slides effortlessly.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Broken Rollers:</strong> The rollers of an aluminum sliding door
        are crucial for smooth operation. Over time, they can wear out or break,
        causing the door to get stuck. We provide roller replacement services to
        restore your door&apos;s functionality.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Misaligned Tracks:</strong> If the track of your sliding door
        becomes bent, warped, or misaligned, it can prevent the door from
        opening and closing properly. Our experts can realign the track or
        replace it entirely for seamless operation.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Damaged Glass:</strong> Accidents happen, and sometimes the
        glass in your aluminum sliding door gets damaged. We can replace cracked
        or broken glass to restore the safety and functionality of your door.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Weather Seal Damage:</strong> Damaged weather seals can let in
        drafts, water, or dirt, compromising the comfort of your home or office.
        We can replace weather seals to ensure your door remains
        energy-efficient and protected from the elements.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>General Wear and Tear:</strong> Over time, all doors experience
        some wear and tear. Our team is skilled at diagnosing and fixing the
        underlying cause of any issue, ensuring your aluminum sliding door is as
        good as new.
